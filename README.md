## Description

In an effort to help students, I created a Bootcamp Study Guide to centralize information and organize how and what to study in preparation for the UW coding Bootcamp. I learned how to set up the framework of the web app in HTML, add style with CSS, and make it interactivw with the help of JavaScript.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about specific topics such as HTML, CSS, Git, or JavaScript. It organizes the information in a list, and if you open up console in devtools, you can see the JavaScript operating. The JS allows us to decide what we are going to study for us, to help us keep our studying efficient and engaging.
